# H1 War Card Game

## H2 Description

This is a simple Python implementation of the classic "War" card game. The game is played between two players who are dealt an equal number of shuffled cards. Each round, both players reveal their top card, and the player with the higher-ranked card wins the round. If the cards are of equal rank, a "war" is initiated, where additional cards are played to determine the winner.

Features

Full deck of 52 standard playing cards (Hearts, Diamonds, Spades, Clubs)

Automatic deck shuffling

Round-by-round gameplay with win conditions

"War" mechanic when two cards of equal rank are drawn

Automatic game loop until one player runs out of cards

How to Play

Run the script in Python.

The game automatically shuffles and distributes the deck between two players.

Each round, both players play the top card of their deck.

The player with the higher card wins and takes both cards.

If the cards are the same rank, a "war" is triggered, and additional cards are drawn to determine the winner.

The game continues until one player has all the cards.

The winner is announced when the other player runs out of cards.
